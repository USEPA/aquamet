# 1 Preliminaries

There are 5 NLA physical habitat indicators that assess condition based on 1) drawdown, 2) riparian vegetation complexity, 3) littoral vegetation complexity, 4) littoral-riparian vegatation complexity, and 5) riparian disturbance. There is a separate function for each of these to calculate the indicator value and assign a condition class. Each indicator function requires specific site-related information (e.g., latitude, longitude) and specific physical habitat metrics to assign condition.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
